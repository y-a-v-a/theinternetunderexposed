# The Internet Underexposed

An artistic web project by ax710 & y-a-v-a (2009) that presents an alternative perspective on internet visibility and exposure.

## Inspiration

This work is directly inspired by and based on [Jan Robert Leegte](http://www.leegte.org/)'s original piece "The Internet Overexposed" (www.theinternetoverexposed.com). Leegte's exploration of internet visibility and digital exposure serves as the conceptual foundation for this underexposed counterpart.
